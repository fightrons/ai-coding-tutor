## Personalized Learning

### Contextual Video Resources
**Current**: Text-based lessons only
**Goal**: Curated video content that reinforces concepts

- Embed relevant tutorial videos within lesson content
- Match videos to specific coding problems/concepts
- Short clips (2-5 min) for quick reinforcement
- Full tutorials for deeper exploration
- Sources: YouTube educational channels, custom recordings

### Adaptive Topic Progression
**Current**: Fixed linear curriculum
**Goal**: Dynamic path based on learner readiness

- Start with ONE core concept per session
- Assess comprehension before introducing new material
- Detect mastery signals (speed, accuracy, confidence)
- Unlock next topic only when current is solid
- Avoid overwhelming with multiple concepts at once

### Interest-Based Next Steps
**Current**: Predetermined lesson order
**Goal**: Suggest what will engage the learner most

- Track which exercises sparked curiosity (time spent, re-attempts)
- Identify patterns: does learner prefer logic puzzles, visual output, real-world apps?
- Recommend next lesson based on interest signals
- "You might enjoy this next..." suggestions
- Balance interest with foundational requirements

---

## Technical Improvements

### Testing Infrastructure
**Current**: No tests
**Priority**: High

#### Recommended Stack

**Unit/Integration Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library**
Vitest is the optimal choice for Vite + React projects:
- Native Vite integration (shares config, transforms, and plugins)
- Jest-compatible API (familiar syntax, easy migration paths)
- Fast HMR-based watch mode for rapid development
- Built-in TypeScript support without additional configuration
- First-class ESM support

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom @vitest/coverage-v8
```

**E2E Tests: Playwright (recommended over Puppeteer)**
Playwright offers significant advantages:
- Multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit/Safari)
- Superior TypeScript integration
- Built-in auto-waiting (more reliable than manual waits)
- Excellent Vite integration via `@playwright/test`
- Parallel test execution out of the box
- Built-in test generator and trace viewer for debugging

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

**Alternative: Puppeteer** (if Chrome-only or specific CI requirements)
- Chrome/Chromium-focused
- Lower-level API, more control
- Smaller bundle if only Chrome is needed

```bash
npm install -D puppeteer jest-puppeteer @types/puppeteer
```

#### Configuration Files

**vitest.config.ts**
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import path from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    globals: true,
    setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
    include: ['src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}'],
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],
      exclude: ['node_modules/', 'src/test/'],
    },
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': path.resolve(__dirname, './src'),
    },
  },
})
```

**playwright.config.ts**
```typescript
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: 'html',

  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:5173',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
})
```

import { afterEach } from 'vitest'

afterEach(() => {
  cleanup()
})
```

#### Mocking Strategy

**Supabase Mocking** (for unit/integration tests)
```typescript
// src/test/mocks/supabase.ts
import { vi } from 'vitest'

export const mockSupabase = {
  auth: {
    getSession: vi.fn(),
    signInWithPassword: vi.fn(),
    signUp: vi.fn(),
    signOut: vi.fn(),
    onAuthStateChange: vi.fn(() => ({ data: { subscription: { unsubscribe: vi.fn() } } })),
  },
  from: vi.fn(() => ({
    select: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    insert: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    update: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    eq: vi.fn().mockReturnThis(),
    single: vi.fn(),
  })),
  functions: {
    invoke: vi.fn(),
  },
}

vi.mock('@/shared/lib/supabase', () => ({
  supabase: mockSupabase,
}))
```

**MSW for API Mocking** (optional, for more realistic integration tests)
```bash
npm install -D msw
```

#### CI Integration (GitHub Actions)

          path: playwright-report/
```

### Caching & State Management
**Current**: Fresh fetches on every navigation
**Priority**: High

- Implement React Query or SWR for lesson/module data
- Background revalidation for stale data
- localStorage fallback for tutor messages (offline access)
- Optimistic updates for progress tracking

### Error Handling
**Current**: Basic try-catch with generic messages
**Priority**: High

- Categorize errors (syntax, runtime, network, auth)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Structured error logging for debugging

### Security Hardening
**Current**: Basic validation
**Priority**: Medium

- Rate limiting on access code validation (prevent brute force)
- Worker-based code execution for true process isolation
- Input sanitization for user-submitted code
- Audit logging for sensitive actions

### Performance Optimization
**Current**: Sequential queries, some artificial delays
**Priority**: Medium

- Batch/RPC calls to reduce database round trips
- React 19 `useTransition` for non-blocking UI updates
- Code splitting for lesson content
- Image optimization with lazy loading

---

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Activity Definition
**Current**: No activity tracking
**Goal**: Define and track user activity for engagement metrics

#### What Counts as Activity?
Need to decide which actions constitute "activity" for tracking purposes:

| Action | Counts? | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Page Load (Authenticated)** | ❓ | Minimum bar - user opened the app |
| **Click "Continue" to current lesson** | ❓ | Shows intent to resume learning |
| **View lesson content** | ❓ | Passive engagement |
| **Run code in editor** | ❓ | Active coding practice |
| **Submit exercise attempt** | ❓ | Explicit learning action |
| **Ask tutor a question** | ❓ | Active engagement with AI |
| **Complete a lesson** | ❓ | Milestone achievement |
| **Idle time on lesson page** | ❓ | May indicate reading/thinking |

#### Proposed Activity Tiers

**Tier 1: Passive Activity** (updates "last seen")
- Loading any authenticated page
- Navigating between lessons
- Opening tutor panel

**Tier 2: Active Engagement** (counts toward daily activity)
- Running code in editor
- Submitting exercise attempts
- Asking tutor questions
- Clicking hints

**Tier 3: Learning Milestones** (achievements/streaks)
- Completing a lesson
- Passing an exercise on first attempt
- Multiple correct submissions in a session

#### Implementation Considerations
- Store `last_activity_at` timestamp on `student_profiles`
- Separate `last_active_date` for daily streak calculation
- Consider debouncing (e.g., multiple code runs within 1 min = 1 activity)
- Decide: Does opening app count for streak, or must user complete something?

#### Open Questions
1. Should page load alone maintain a streak?
2. Minimum engagement time per session?
3. Track per-lesson activity vs global activity?
4. Privacy: How long to retain detailed activity logs?

### Learning Analytics
- Event tracking: lesson start, code execution, hint requests, completion
- Time-to-completion metrics
- Failure pattern analysis
- Hint usage correlation to success rates

### Observability
- Structured logging (JSON format) for production
- Error tracking integration (Sentry/LogRocket)
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- OpenAI API cost tracking and usage alerts

---

## DevOps & Infrastructure

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions for lint, test, build on PR
- Automated deployment to Vercel on merge
- Database migration automation
- Environment-specific configs (staging/production)

### Developer Experience
- Pre-commit hooks (lint, type-check)
- Storybook for component documentation
- API mocking (MSW) for local development
- Constants file for magic numbers
